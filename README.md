# VoiceEngineAPI


This Library/SDK/API is a like a Factory wrapper Interface , if you find yourself working with multiple Voice Recognition Engine Implementations. Each Voice Recognition Engine Implementation ( Google Voice , Nuance ) has its own Interface and API. And that's a design and Re-factoring nightmare.
Easy to add another Engine, change priorities of selection order at runtime ( if multiple Engine providers are present ).
